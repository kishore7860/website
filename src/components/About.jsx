          I’m a highly motivated and technically skilled AI Developer with a Master’s degree in Computer Science from 
          <strong> Saint Louis University</strong> and a strong foundation in electronics from my Bachelor’s at 
          <strong> Vellore Institute of Technology</strong>, India. My academic journey has been guided by a deep passion 
          for intelligent systems and solving real-world problems through technology.
          <br /><br />
          Through hands-on projects and internships, I’ve gained experience building full-stack AI applications, 
          developing end-to-end MLOps pipelines, and working with modern frameworks like <strong>OpenAI, MLflow, ZenML</strong>, 
          and <strong>Docker</strong>. Whether it’s building intelligent tutors using Retrieval-Augmented Generation or 
          deploying scalable machine learning models, I bring both technical excellence and creativity to the table.
          <br /><br />
          I’m currently seeking opportunities where I can contribute as an <strong>AI Engineer or Developer</strong>, 
          combining my experience with a strong drive to innovate, collaborate, and grow in the fast-evolving field of 
          artificial intelligence. This portfolio reflects my journey, skills, and the value I’m ready to bring to your team.
